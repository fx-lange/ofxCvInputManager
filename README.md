ofxCvInputManager
=================

ofxCvInputManager is an openFrameworks addon to manage different inputs (video,cams,snapshots) while working on your CV algorithms. it was created as a byproduct to my bachelor thesis (Skeleton2D - https://github.com/fx-lange/ofxSkeleton2D) and will certainly be developed further in upcoming projects as needed.

Send me a message if you have any questions or suggestions!
